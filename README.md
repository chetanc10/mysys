# snips

This repository shall contain collections of bash-scripts/combos, vim-addons, notes, linux-drivers, userspace apps/modules, etc

Motivation

Becoming and being one of those lazy software people, I've decided to setup small scripts, addons, etc for better and easier work-control on my Ubuntu, the Linux distro.. Again my interest for testing various C and Kernel concepts, I've collected many small files which demonstrate the working of the concepts. Managing that, however small the number of source files was, was going to be clumsy. Finally, sharing is important! So here we are..!

Installation

TBD
